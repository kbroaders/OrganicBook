The book is written in R Markdown, using RStudio as my text editor and the **bookdown** package to turn a collection of markdown documents into a coherent whole. The book's source code is hosted on GitHub, at https://github.com/kbroaders/OrganicBook. If you notice typos or other issues, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request.
