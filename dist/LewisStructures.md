## Counting valence electrons {#valence}

Remember that the periodic table is organized in order of increasing number of protons in an atom's nucleus. Because atoms are neutral they have the same number of negatively charged electrons as positively charged protons. This means that the atomic number you see on a periodic table is the **total number of electrons** on an atom of that element.

Because of the quirks of quantum mechanics, the electrons aren't all in a jumble around the nucleus, though. They occupy spaces called *orbitals* with various shapes and sizes (see \@ref(atomic-orbitals) for more information)
